# KramHubitat
Here you'll find apps and drivers written by me for use in my own Hubitat home automation system. You're welcome to use them wherever and however you like. They are supplied as-is, with no warranty, no liability accepted if things go horribly wrong, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah. :)

Whilst I'd love to hear from you if you find any of these useful, or have suggestions for improvement, please bear in mind that this is just one of my hobbies and I may not be able to respond immediately.
